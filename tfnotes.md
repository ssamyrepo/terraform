### ✅ **Terraform notes**

* **Terraform** is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool by HashiCorp that allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure using configuration files.
* **Declarative Syntax**: You describe the desired state of your infrastructure; Terraform figures out how to achieve it.

---

### 🛠️ **Setup and Core Commands**

* Install Terraform from the [official site](https://terraform.io).
* Basic CLI workflow:

  * `terraform init`: Initialize working directory and download provider plugins.
  * `terraform plan`: Preview infrastructure changes.
  * `terraform apply`: Apply the planned changes.
  * `terraform destroy`: Tear down the infrastructure.

---

### 📦 **State Management**

* **State File (`terraform.tfstate`)**: Stores the current state of your infrastructure.
* **Remote Backends** (e.g., S3, Terraform Cloud): Enable collaboration, locking, and versioning.

---

### 🔧 **Variables & Outputs**

* Use `variables.tf` to define inputs and `terraform.tfvars` to provide values.
* `output` blocks expose information (e.g., IP addresses) after apply.
* Supports environment-specific overrides using `*.auto.tfvars` or CLI flags (`-var`, `-var-file`).

---

### 🧩 **Resource Control**

* Meta-arguments:

  * `count`: Create multiple instances of a resource.
  * `depends_on`: Explicitly declare resource dependencies.
  * `provisioner`: Execute scripts during resource creation (used sparingly).

---

### 📚 **Modules and Reusability**

* **Modules** group reusable infrastructure logic.
* Can be local or sourced from the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io).
* Use defaults and input validation to improve usability.

---

### 🌐 **Multi-Environment Strategies**

* **Workspaces**: Allow multiple state files in the same config for environments like dev/stage/prod.
* **Directory Structure**: Separate folders per environment (e.g., `prod/`, `dev/`) for clarity and better version control.

---

### ✅ **Testing Infrastructure**

* **Static Checks**: `terraform fmt`, `terraform validate`.
* **Automated Tests**: Use [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/) (Go-based) for testing infrastructure logic with retry logic and assertions.

---

### 🔄 **CI/CD Integration**

* Use **GitHub Actions** or other pipelines to:

  * Run `terraform fmt`, `validate`, `plan`, `apply`
  * Automate tagging and deployments for environments
  * Enforce code quality checks pre-merge
